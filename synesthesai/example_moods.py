    "I'm DJing a really cool party in Manhattan. I need music that won't get in the way of people's conversations but will get them moving. I'll be laughed out of the building if I play anything on the Billboard top 100 so keep it underground.",
    "Got a case of the 80s. I need something so synth it bleeds neon",

    "Gardening on a crisp day. Let's make Mother Nature proud and make the worms wiggle",
    "Bring on the auditory surf and sand vibes for this sunset chill session by the beach. Me want vitamin sea",
    "I want to cry. I need music that could make a statue fall to its knees in tears. Shatter my heart and crush my soul",
    "Just split with my sweetheart. Need the healing catharsis of a punk rock anthem",
    "Diving into the seedy underbelly of a detective novel at my favorite hipster caf√©. I want to feel like I'm in a noir film that only true cinema buffs know about.",
    "In the throes of a brutal workout. Got a taste for something raw and unfettered, far from the polished gym anthems",
    "Throwing a dinner party that oozes sophistication. I want the time-honored, overlooked tunes that pair well with red wine and philosophical conversation.",
    "Just hit a new peak with a big promotion!! I want the hidden gems that'll have me dancing on the rooftops!",
    "Channeling my inner artist. Give me the audacious strokes of an underground punk zine",
